Computer Vision, as a relatively young research area, has emerged as a key discipline in computer science. This is not only evident by a growing and highly competitive research community with a high impact factor in computer science, but also by the emergence of numerous vision companies turning research ideas into a myriad of commercial applications. Besides well-known studies of 3D geometry and camera models, object tracking and detection in images and videos becomes one of the principal research directions of modern Computer Vision. The main objective of this course is to provide students with a gradual introduction to modern tracking, detection and recognition techniques developed in the last years. The course will provide in-depth knowledge of image features, their detection and description, matching techniques, key-point recognition, basic and advanced tracking algorithms based on image features and image intensities, basics of structure from motion and bundle adjustment, synchronous localization and mapping algorithms as well as object detection using classification approaches. In the end, the students will have a thorough description of the most important tracking and detection techniques. They should be able to understand and implement those solutions and apply them in reasonably complex problems. The concepts described in this course will be accompanied with brief explanations of the necessary mathematical tools. The participants of this course will be given an important basis to follow the vast and growing Computer Vision literature and use the acquired knowledge to solve new practical problems.

My name is Yingqiang. I'm a Charizard trainer, poet and full-time thinker. I study the endogeneous factors that trigger the mega evolution of Fire and Dragon type Pokemons, and Natural Language Processing. 

I come from the city of Jinan (済南), Shandong province. This is where the two greatest Song Ci poets, Li Qing Zhao (李清照) and Xin Qi Ji (辛弃疾, I see him as my life long mentor), were born and raised.

我说汉语。I speak English. Deutsch ist für mich auch kein Problem.

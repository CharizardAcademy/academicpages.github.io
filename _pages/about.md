My name is 英强 (aka Yingqiang). I wear multiple hats as a Charizard trainer, poet, flutist, and a full-time thinker. I'm currently diving deep into studying the endogenous factors that trigger the mega evolution of Fire and Dragon type Pokemons, alongside exploring the intriguing world of Natural Language Processing. 

I come from the city of Jinan ([濟南](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan)), Shandong province in China. Here is where the two prominent poets of the Song Dynasty, Li Qing Zhao ([李清照](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qingzhao)) and Xin Qi Ji ([辛弃疾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_Qiji), whom I see as my life long mentor), were born and raised.

I have a strong interest in philosophy of the pre-Qin dynasty era, especially Confucianism and its influence on the Chinese ethical system.

I now live in Switzerland and work as a Ph.D student affiliated at [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html), University of Zurich and ETH Zürich. Before joining INI, I completed my master study at [Technische Universität München](https://tum.de) (TUM) and bachelor study at [Tongji University Shanghai](https://www.tongji.edu.cn) (上海同济大学).

I hate cheese and love coriander.

我说汉语。 I speak English.  Ich spreche Deutsch.

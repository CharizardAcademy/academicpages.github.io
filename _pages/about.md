My name is Yingqiang. I'm a Charizard trainer, poet, flutist and full-time thinker. I study the endogeneous factors that trigger the mega evolution of Fire and Dragon type Pokemons, and Natural Language Processing. 

I come from the city of Jinan ([濟南](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan)), Shandong province in China. This is where the two greatest Song Ci poets, Li Qing Zhao ([李清照](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qingzhao)) and Xin Qi Ji ([辛弃疾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_Qiji), I see him as my life long mentor), were born and raised.

I have high enthusiasm for Pre-Qin Period Phisolosy, especially Confusianism. Besides that, I'm a bad cook and have no interests in any type of cheese at all. 

I now live in Switzerland and work as a Ph.D student affiliated at [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html), University of Zurich and ETH Zürich. Before joining INI, I completed my master study at [Technische Universität München](https://tum.de) (TUM) and bachelor study at [Tongji University Shanghai](https://www.tongji.edu.cn) (同济大学).

 

我说汉语。I speak English. Deutsch ist für mich auch kein Problem.
